## Course objective

"Numerical methods are used frequently in all areas of science, such as fluid dynamics, meteorology and financial risk management. Moreover, techniques from numerical analysis play an important role in mathematical research on differential equations, stochastics, optimization, etcetera. We focus on the main numerical methods from modern-day analysis and scientific computing."

-Shane Kepley, Numerical Methods course professor at Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.
